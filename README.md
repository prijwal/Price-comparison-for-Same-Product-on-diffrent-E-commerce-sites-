# Real-time-price-comparison-for-Same-Product-on-diffrent-E-commerce-sites-
This Project is an exciting application of Python as well as web scraping techniques. This project is on "Real time Price comparison using Python". Here I will be working on an end-to-end project to monitor price comparison for a particular product on different e-commerce websites using Python and send you an e-mail regarding which site has the least price. Here I compared prices of the New Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max (256GB) - Pacific Blue on Amazon and Flipkart.
